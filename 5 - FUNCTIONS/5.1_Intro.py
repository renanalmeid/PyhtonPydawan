#We will perform these three steps every time users have to travel between two points using our trip application. In our programs, we could rewrite the same procedures over and over (and over) for each time we want to travel, but there’s a better way! Python gives us a useful concept called functions.

#Functions are a convenient way to group our code into reusable blocks. A function contains a sequence of steps that can be performed repeatedly throughout a program without having to repeat the process of writing the same code again.

#In this lesson, we are going to explore the idea of a function by slowly building out a Python program for our trip planning steps!

#At the end of this lesson, you’ll know how to:

#Write a function and return values from it.
#Allow functions to take custom input.
#Experiment with how functions access our other python code.
