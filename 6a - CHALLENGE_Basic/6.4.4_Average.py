#Letâ€™s create a function which takes the average of two numbers. 

def average(num1, num2):
  sum = num1+num2
  av = sum/2
  return av

# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
