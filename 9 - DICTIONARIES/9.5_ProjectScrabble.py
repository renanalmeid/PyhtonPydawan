#We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

#After defining point_total, create a for loop that goes through the letters in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total.
#You should get the point value from the letter_to_points dictionary. If the letter you are checking for is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.
